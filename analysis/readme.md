# Analysis

## matlab
Matlab code for data requests and analyses of met package datasets.
- `M2M_Data_Figure2.m` and `Figure2.m` are the required scripts for Figure 2. `Figure2.mlx` is the Live Script file containing all necessary materials.
- `pullOOIdata.m` and `plotOOI_metbk.m` are the required scripts for Figure 3.
- `M2M_Data_Figure5.m` and `Figure5.m` are the required scripts for Figure 2. `Figure5.mlx` is the Live Script file containing all necessary materials.

## python
*ProfilerCTD_RequestsAndAnalysis.ipynb* iPython Jupyter notebook contains the code and instructions for OOI data requests via the thredds server using the python, similar to the examples indicated in *dataAccess.ipynb*. Data reformatting, analysis, and plotting are also included in the same notebook, with all information needed for replicatoin of Figures 6 and 7 of Levine et al.
